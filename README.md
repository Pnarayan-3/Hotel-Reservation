# Hotel Reservation (Project using JDBC)

Project Description:
The Hotel Reservation System is a terminal-based Java application that allows users to manage hotel bookings and operations efficiently. It is developed using Java for the application logic and MySQL as the backend database, connected through JDBC (Java Database Connectivity).

The system is designed to handle key hotel operations such as guest registration, room booking, check-in/check-out processes, and viewing reservation details. All interactions occur through the command-line interface, making it lightweight and easy to run on any system with Java and MySQL installed.

Key Features:
Guest Management: Add, update, and view guest information.
Room Management: Track available, booked, and occupied rooms.
Booking Functionality: Create new reservations with automated date/time and availability checks.
Check-in/Check-out: Record guest arrivals and departures, and update room status accordingly.
Search & View: Query booking and customer details by guest ID, room number, or date.
Data Persistence: All data is stored and retrieved securely from a MySQL database using JDBC.
Error Handling: Robust error checking for invalid input, unavailable rooms, or conflicting reservations.
